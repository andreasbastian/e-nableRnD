e-NABLE R&D
Andreas Bastian, 2014

Project Summaries:
-**XY plane phalanges**
FDM-printed objects are typically strongest in the XY plane.  These phalanges print with the stress and strength planes aligned to improve durability.

-**differential tensioner**
Development of a Raptor Reloaded drop-in flexsor tensioning module to facilitate differential grasping.

-**monoforms**
Experiments in flat-packable, thermoformable simple hook tools.  Ultimate fabrication method likely die-/laser-cut thermoplastic sheet stock.

-**print-in-place**
An area of particular interest.  Explorations of phalanges and hands printed fully assembled, without any fasteners.

-**pulley palm**
Experiments in reducing flexsor line friction via the introduction of tangetially-aligned printed pulleys

-**sugru overmolding**
Proof-of-concept for simple overmolding technique using a printed mold and Sugru.  [Instructable here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Sugru-Overmolding-Using-3D-Printed-Molds/).  

-**thermoforming**
Another area of particular interest.  Thermoforming allows the fabrication of forms stronger than those that can be conventionally produced on FDM hardware and facilitates accurate form fitting via a very analog contact-base molding process. [Introductory Instructable here](http://www.instructables.com/id/Thermoforming-3D-Printed-PLA-for-Use-in-Prostethic/).

-**unibody hand**
Early 2014 concept exploration for compliant and durable materials like Nylon, PET, and Filaflex:  a hand devoid of fasteners, elastics, flexsor cables, or tensioning systems.
