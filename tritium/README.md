## Tritium
Andreas Bastian, December 2014

Tritium is an experimental assistive device for those affected with ABS, symbrachydactyly, and other upper limb differences that affect the digits, but leave a uncitoning wrist and palm.

The goal of this device is to fast-track the most impactful developments and ideas from the e-NABLE community into one device.  These features are as follows:

- Metacarpal arch
- Differential grasping capability
- Two degrees of motion at the wrist (both flexion/extension and raiod-ulnar deviation)
- Opposable/bi-stable thumb to enable oppositional grasping
- No elastic cords
- No knots
- Minimal supplemental hardware
- Single-handed tightening/loosening of securing straps
- Thermoformable components for secure and firm fit
